                    <h2> Brazilian funk </h2>
                    <p> Funk carioca ([ˈfɐ̃k(i) ˌkɐɾiˈɔkɐ]), also known as favela funk, in other parts of the world as
                        baile funk and Brazilian funk, or even simply funk, is a hip hop-influenced music genre from Rio
                        de Janeiro, blending the rap subgenres of Miami bass and gangsta rap.[1][2] Despite its name,
                        funk carioca has no musical correlation with the American funk by any means.[3]

                        In Brazil, "Baile funk" refers not to the music, but to the actual parties or discotheques in
                        which the music is played (Portuguese pronunciation: [ˈbajli], from baile, meaning "ball").[4]
                        Although originated in Rio, "Funk carioca" has become increasingly popular among working classes
                        in other parts of Brazil. In the whole country, funk carioca is most often simply known as
                        "funk", although it is very musically different from what with "funk music" is internationally
                        meant.[5] In fact, it still shows its urban Afro beats influences.</p>

                    <h2> Latin Urban Music </h2>
                    <p> Urbano music (Spanish: música urbana) or Latin urban is a transnational umbrella category
                        including many different genres and styles. As an umbrella term it includes reggaeton,
                        dancehall, dembow, urban champeta, funk carioca and Latin hip hop. The commercial breakthrough
                        of this music took place in 2017. Artists in style collaborate transnationally and may originate
                        from the United States (including Puerto Rico), Colombia, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Panama,
                        Venezuela or other Spanish-speaking nations, as well as Portuguese-speaking Brazil.[1]

                    <h2> Reggae </h2>
                    <p>Reggae (/ˈrɛɡeɪ/) is a music genre that originated in Jamaica in the late 1960s. The term also
                        denotes the modern popular music of Jamaica and its diaspora.[1] A 1968 single by Toots and the
                        Maytals, "Do the Reggay", was the first popular song to use the word reggae, effectively naming
                        the genre and introducing it to a global audience.[2][3] While sometimes used in a broad sense
                        to refer to most types of popular Jamaican dance music, the term reggae more properly denotes a
                        particular music style that was strongly influenced by traditional mento as well as by American
                        jazz and rhythm and blues, and evolved out of the earlier genres ska and rocksteady.[4] Reggae
                        usually relates news, social gossip, and political commentary.[5] It is instantly recognizable
                        from the counterpoint between the bass and drum downbeat and the offbeat rhythm section. The
                        immediate origins of reggae were in ska and rocksteady; from the latter, reggae took over the
                        use of the bass as a percussion instrument.[ </p>

                <h2>Techno Music</h2>
                <p>Techno is a genre of electronic dance music[2] (EDM) which is generally produced for use in a
                    continuous DJ set, with tempo often varying between 120 and 150 (as per Marcello Perri) beats per
                    minute (bpm). The central rhythm is typically in common time (4/4) and often characterized by a
                    repetitive four on the floor beat.[3] Artists may use electronic instruments such as drum machines,
                    sequencers, and synthesizers, as well as digital audio workstations. Drum machines from the 1980s
                    such as Roland's TR-808 and TR-909 are highly prized, and software emulations of such retro
                    instruments are popular.</p>
